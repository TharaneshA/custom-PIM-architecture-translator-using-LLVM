MEMORY MAPPING ALGORITHM:

1. Memory Analysis:
   - Analyze memory access patterns in LLVM IR
   - Identify frequently accessed memory regions
   - Calculate memory bandwidth requirements

2. PIM Memory Allocation:
   - Determine optimal PIM memory regions
   - Map data structures to PIM memory
   - Consider data locality and access patterns

3. Address Translation:
   - Generate virtual-to-physical address mapping
   - Create memory access descriptors
   - Handle memory consistency requirements

4. Optimization:
   - Minimize data movement between host and PIM
   - Balance memory distribution between host and PIM
   - Optimize for PIM memory characteristics

Design Considerations:
- Support multiple PIM memory architectures
- Handle both regular and irregular memory patterns
- Provide detailed memory access statistics
- Integrate with loop analyzer for co-optimization
